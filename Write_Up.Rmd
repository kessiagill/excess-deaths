# Is there a link between certain Covid-19 vaccines and 2023 excess all-cause mortality in the EU?

 To remember:

- Rename excess_death.xlsx to excess_mortality.xlsx
- ONLY homemade functions in .py files
- Check we are using excess death and excess mortality correctly throughout
- rename variables clearly
- comments on lines of code
- justify use of our specific datasets - are there other datasets looking at same thing

```{python}
#Importing necessary libraries 
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Safe setting for Pandas.  Needs Pandas version >= 1.5.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

Running the following line of code will fetch the vaccination data we will use in our project, however due to issues obtaining a direct download link for the excess mortality data, please refer to the README.md file for further instructions before proceeding with the rest of this notebook.

## Introduction 

There is ongoing debate in public health discourse about the relationship between COVID-19 vaccinations and excess mortality in the post-pandemic era . This discussion has gained traction in light of various countries reporting unexpected excess mortality rates following widespread vaccine rollout. The discourse is complicated by contrasting interpretations of data by health authorities, researchers, and policymakers, leading to a complex mix of perspectives on the factors influencing recent trends of excess mortality. This controversy underscores the need for transparent analysis into whether COVID-19 vaccination campaigns have influenced population health outcomes.

This project seeks to explore whether there is an association between excess all-cause mortality seen across European Union (EU) countries post-Covid 19 pandemic and Covid-19 vaccines. Our investigation spans 30 countries, encompassing the 27 EU member states, along with Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.

Excess all-cause mortality, which measures the percentage deviation between observed and expected deaths from any cause in a given period, provides a  lens through which we can assess the macro level impacts of the pandemic and vaccination efforts. To explore the relationship between Covid-19 vaccination and excess all-cause mortality, we utilise linear regression as our primary analytical approach.

The inclusion of 30 European countries in our study provides a rich dataset that enables us to investigate potential links between different vaccination types and variations in excess all-cause mortality. This research seeks to uncover insights into the factors influencing post-pandemic mortality patterns.

## Literature review

Excess mortality following the COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns globally. Various countries have reported significant deviations from expected mortality rates. Notably, the United States witnessed a substantial 5-12% weekly increase in all-cause excess mortality during the latter half of 2022 (CDC, 2023). Similarly, the United Kingdom experienced six consecutive quarters of excess mortality as of September 2023 (O'Dowd, 2023), and Australia recorded a 7% excess death rate in the first five months of 2023, through attributed half of these deaths to COVID-19 (Adair, 2023). 

The underlying causes of post-pandemic excess mortality remain a subject of debate and investigation. In a UK parliamentary debate on October 20, 2023, former Tory MP Andrew Bridgen stated that COVID-19 vaccines were rushed through trials and therefore might be contributing to the observed increase in excess mortality. Bridgen criticised the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for mishandling data to promote a pro-vaccine agenda.

The UK Department for Health and Social Care asserted that there was no evidence linking excess mortality to COVID-19 vaccines. The published report has since been removed from the government website, but can still be accessed [here](https://dailysceptic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Final-Briefing-on-Excess-Deaths-24-October-2023.pdf). The report has many shortcomings. It considered all vaccine types homogenously and there were inconsistencies in reported data related on the number of unvaccinated individuals, monthly death figures, and age-standardized mortality rate calculations (Jefferson and Heneghan, 2023). 

Vaccine safety concerns were initiated during the Covid-19 pandemic with the suspension of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine in several European countries due to concerns over rare blood clots (McGrail, 2021). The debate over vaccine safety has been further fueled by reports of side effects, such as elevated risks of myo/pericarditis associated with mRNA vaccines, though the causal links remain unclear (Alami et al., 2023). A study by Aarstad and Kvitastein (2023) found a correlation between 2021 general vaccination uptake in Europe and increased 2022 all-cause mortality, they conclude that one percentage point increase in 2021 general vaccination uptake was associated with a 2022 monthly mortality increase of 0.105 percent. 


Contrarily, other factors have been suggested as contributors to the recent spike in excess deaths. These include increased incidences of flu, the lasting effects of Covid-19 (long Covid), and strained healthcare services leading to delayed treatments and diagnoses (McDonald, 2022).

To develop the discourse on this debate it is necessary to explore an association between the uptake of individual vaccines and excess mortality. Given the varied excess death rates across Europe and the utilisation of different vaccine types, the European Union offers a rich dataset for exploring potential links between different COVID-19 vaccines and mortality rates.

## Excess mortality data 

Eurostat's excess mortality indicator is part of the European Statistical Recovery Dashboard and takes the number of people who died from any cause in a given period and compares it with a historical baseline from previous years. In the case of the dataset we will be using, this baseline consists of the average number of deaths that occurred each month during the period 2016-2019.  

The term excess death refers to the absolute difference between the number of observed and expected deaths in a given period (CITE). To better enable comparisons across countries with large differences in population, this project investigates excess *mortality*, which refers to the percentage difference between the observed and expected number of deaths.

In particular, we will be looking at *all-cause* excess mortality, which refers to the percentage difference in the number of observed deaths from any cause in a given period, compared to the expected number of deaths from any cause in that given period.


Therefore, when referring to excess mortality throughout this project, we will be referring to the percentage difference in additional deaths from any cause in comparison to the average monthly deaths in 2016-2019. The higher the value, the higher the number of additional deaths, with negative numbers indicating fewer deaths compared to the basline period.

This excess mortality indicator is based on a data collection in which National Statistical Institutes from the European Union (EU) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have transmitted weekly deaths data to Eurostat on a voluntary basis since April 2020. This weekly deaths dataset is then used to compute the monthly excess mortality indicator by mapping the deaths of each week to a full month. 

The data covered in this analysis include all deaths that have occurred since January 2020 and up until September 2023. It is important to note that excess mortality has not been previously been recorded at the same scale as that during, and since, the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, we were unable to find data with which to compare the recent (post-Covid-19) variance in excess mortality, and we acknowledge our inability to determine how unusual this variance is as one limitation of this project.

#### Cleaning excess mortality data
The data downloads and reads an awkward format. The country column is labelled as 'TIME'. Each month excess mortality data point also comes with an adjacent column labelling whether it is confirmed data, provisional data or estimated data. Countries are also labelled with their full names. In order to work with the data, we had to complete some provisional cleaning which is detailed below.

```{python}
#Reading in initial excess mortality data
dirty_mortality = pd.read_excel('data/excess_death.xlsx', sheet_name = 'Sheet 1', skiprows=7, skipfooter=6)
dirty_mortality.head()
```

We need to remove any non-numerical data. This meant we had to first remove the columns which labelled the corresponding data point with NaN, p or ep (confirmed, provisional or estimated provisional). Examining the data you can see that most of the data in 2021 is confirmed with a few countries remaining provisional. Data for 2022 becomes majority provisional and data for 2023 is almost all provisional. There are only 4 estimated data points in the dataset and they are all for the latest recorded month of data - September 2023. 


- Provisional data in this dataset is defined as ......
- Acknowledge this as a potential limitation

```{python}
# Remove columns labelling rates that are estimated or provisional data 
only_numbers = dirty_mortality.loc[:, ~dirty_mortality.columns.str.startswith('Unnamed')]
```

We then had to set the index as the country names, and relabelled the index 'Country'.

```{python}
# Set index as country names and change index title
excess_mortality = only_numbers.set_index('TIME').rename_axis('Country')
```

The vaccine data (yet to be read in) refers to EU countries by country code, as oppose to country name as in this dataset. In order to merge the data later on in the project, we needed a common label for each country so that the relevant mortality data matches up to the relevant vaccination data. We chose to use country codes as they are shorter and therefore marginally easier to code with in data analysis.  

```{python}
# Creating dictionary to convert countries to corresponding country code
country_code_dict = {
    'Belgium': 'BE', 
    'Bulgaria': 'BG', 
    'Czechia': 'CZ', 
    'Denmark': 'DK', 
    'Germany': 'DE', 
    'Estonia': 'EE',
    'Ireland': 'IE', 
    'Greece': 'GR', 
    'Spain': 'ES', 
    'France': 'FR', 
    'Croatia': 'HR', 
    'Italy': 'IT',
    'Cyprus': 'CY', 
    'Latvia': 'LV', 
    'Lithuania': 'LT', 
    'Luxembourg': 'LU', 
    'Hungary': 'HU', 
    'Malta': 'MT',
    'Netherlands': 'NL', 
    'Austria': 'AT', 
    'Poland': 'PL', 
    'Portugal': 'PT', 
    'Romania': 'RO',
    'Slovenia': 'SI', 
    'Slovakia': 'Sk', 
    'Finland': 'FI', 
    'Sweden': 'SE', 
    'Iceland': 'IS',
    'Liechtenstein': 'LI',
    'Norway': 'NO', 
    'Switzerland': 'CH', 
    }
#Adding a new column called 'ReportingCountry' with associated country codes
excess_mortality['ReportingCountry'] = excess_mortality.index.map(country_code_dict)
excess_mortality.head()

```

## Covid-19 Vaccination data


Our data on Covid-19 vaccination comes from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's Vaccine Tracker, and covers EU and EEA (European Economic Area) countries.

The data is collected through The European Surveillance System (TESSy), and are submitted by European Union/European Economic Area countries to the ECDC once every four weeks. EU/EEA Member States report aggregated vaccination data by age and specific target groups, with doses reported by vaccine product.

#### Cleaning vaccination data

```{python}
#Reading in initial vaccination data
dirty_vaccine_data = pd.read_excel('data/vaccine_types.xlsx')
dirty_vaccine_data.head()
```

There were many columns not relevant to our investigation, and therefore we have removed them.

```{python}
#Dropping unwanted columns
cut_down_dvd = dirty_vaccine_data.drop(['Denominator', 'NumberDosesReceived', 'NumberDosesExported', 'FirstDoseRefused', 'DoseAdditional1', 'DoseAdditional2', 'DoseAdditional3', 'DoseAdditional4', 'DoseAdditional5', 'UnknownDose'], axis = 1)
```

Some countries listed both a total count and a count by region. The majority of countries only included a total vaccine count so we removed any counts by region.

```{python}
#Remove regions to only get full country
no_regions = cut_down_dvd[cut_down_dvd['ReportingCountry'] == cut_down_dvd['Region']]
```

The data for some countries, including Finland, had duplicated rows for the some weeks. To resolve this we removed any duplicate rows where the 'YearWeekISO', 'ReportingCountry', and 'FirstDose' column were all identical.

```{python}
#Drop duplicate rows
vaccine_data = no_regions.drop_duplicates(subset = ['YearWeekISO', 'ReportingCountry', 'FirstDose'])
vaccine_data
```

Given there were duplicate counts due to the 'Region' column and duplicated rows, we also deciced to check that there is no duplication or multiple counts of the same vaccine in the 'Vaccine' column denominating vaccine type. The breakdown of vaccines for the data set (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Variable_Dictionary_VaccineTracker-5-april-2023.pdf) provides info on each of the vaccines administered. 

Some of the vaccines are adaptations of the general vaccine e.g. COM refers to the Pfizer BioNTech - Comirnaty whilst COMBA.4-5 refers to a variant of the COM vaccine targetting Original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5.

Based on the huge numbers of the major vaccines e.g. COM, we can be confident they are vaccines themselves and not cumulative sums of all the COM vaccine variations.

- MAKE THIS MAKE SENSE ^^^^

```{python}
vaccine_data.groupby('Vaccine')['FirstDose'].sum()
```

## Analysis

### Descriptive statistics


After cleaning our data, we have obtained the following dataframe for excess mortality:

```{python}
excess_mortality.head()
```

Each row of the dataframe corresponds to a reporting country, and the values within each row the correspond to that country's percentage difference in deaths from any cause in that month, in comparison to the average monthly deaths in 2016-2019.


And the following dataframe for Covid-19 vaccination:

```{python}
vaccine_data.head()
```

Each row in this dataframe represents - HOW TO SAY THIS ???


The following dataframe summarise the excess mortality data:

```{python}
# Creating a dataframe to describe the data
excess_mortality.describe()
```

- FIX THIS AND REFLECT ON IT - POINT OUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO CONTEXTUALISE THE DATA


The following dataframe summarises the vaccination data:

```{python}
# Creating a dataframe to describe the data - using a function to remove the scientific notation output
vaccine_data.describe().apply(lambda s: s.apply('{0:.5f}'.format))
```

- FIX THIS AND REFLECT ON IT - POINT OUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO CONTEXTUALISE THE DATA

### First Look
In order to get an idea of excess mortality across Europe we have calculated a mean excess mortality for the 9 recorded months of 2023 for all EU countries and the EU as a whole.
We chose to focus on excess mortality from the beginning of 2023 because: 
1) the majority of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in 2021 and 2022


```{python}
#Adding a year column
vaccine_data['Year'] = vaccine_data['YearWeekISO'].str[:4].str.strip()
#Displaying counts of first vaccination dose by year
vaccine_data.groupby('Year')['FirstDose'].sum()
```

```{python}
#Displaying counts of second vaccination dose by year
vaccine_data.groupby('Year')['SecondDose'].sum()
```

2) excess deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed in ___ there have been very little deaths due to covid in 2023 - CHECK and reference


```{python}
plt.plot(excess_mortality.columns, excess_mortality.loc['European Union - 27 countries (from 2020)'])
```

This is interesting - with the basis being 2016-2019 data we have a consistent raise in mortality  

- We would expect mortality to drop into negative post Covid because all the people who have died can't die again - though this makes the assumption that Covid disproportionally killed vulnerable people
- With the basis


3) In order to perform a fair investigation into the whether COVID-19 vaccines are playing a role in mortality we decided to use the year 2023 as a cutoff point - vaccination counts are counted up until 2023 and excess mortality mean is calculated from the beggining of 2023. In this case our study mirrors the approach taken by Aarstad and Kvitastein (2023) in their recent paper which regressed all cause mortality in the first 9 months of 2022 on vaccination uptake (at the turn of 2022).
- ^ add in intro - we are testing what they tested with more and newer data and expanding upon their paper by looking at individual vaccine types afterwards

```{python}
# Select only months for 2023
months_2023 = ['2023-01', '2023-02', '2023-03', '2023-04', '2023-05', '2023-06', '2023-07', '2023-08', '2023-09']

# Add a mean excess all cause mortality by EU country for 2023 
excess_mortality['Mean 2023'] = excess_mortality[months_2023].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce').mean(axis = 1)

# Sort in order of excess all cause mortality for 2023
excess_mortality.sort_values('Mean 2023')
```

```{python}
plt.hist(excess_mortality.index, excess_mortality['Mean 2023'])
```

##### Inital regression of mean excess mortality against vaccination percentage for EU countries


To allow for population size we needed to calculate the percentage of countries that had been vaccinated.

The first dose column contains the number of first dose vaccines administered to individuals during the reporting week. We summed all of these values up unitl 2023, to get a total number of people in each country who had received a first dose of any type of vaccine. By selecting first dose only, we used a binary categorisation i.e., vaccinated or not.
 
- When explain merge highlight the fact that two of the columns from the excess mortality dataframe are lost due to not being present in the vaccination dataset - switzerland and total eu

```{python}
total_vaxed_up_to_23 = vaccine_data[vaccine_data['Year'] != '2023'][vaccine_data['TargetGroup'] == 'ALL'].groupby('ReportingCountry')['FirstDose'].sum()
```

We then needed to find the population of each country to convert this to a percentage. We took the population of each country to be the population as of week 1 in 2023. 

```{python}
#taking the population for each country in as of the first week of 2023
population_wk1_23 = vaccine_data[vaccine_data['YearWeekISO'] == '2023-W01'].groupby('ReportingCountry')['Population'].first()

#Converting the number of people vaccinated into a proportion of the population
percent_vaxed_wk1_23= total_vaxed_up_to_23/population_wk1_23 * 100
percent_vaxed_wk1_23
```

To run the regression we selected the mean 2023 and reporting country column from the excess mortality dataframe. We merged this with the percentage vaccinated column to create a dataframe with percentage vaccinated, mean excess deaths in 2023 for each country. When doing this we were unable to preserve data for Switzerland for both the total EU and Switzerland as these were not included in the vaccine dataset. 

```{python}
just_code_and_mean = excess_mortality[['ReportingCountry', 'Mean 2023']]
merged = pd.merge(just_code_and_mean, pd.DataFrame(percent_vaxed_wk1_23), on = 'ReportingCountry').rename(columns ={0: '% Vaxed'})
merged.head()
```

```{python}
regression = sps.linregress(merged['% Vaxed'], merged['Mean 2023'])
```

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(merged['% Vaxed'],merged['Mean 2023'])

for i in range(len(merged)):
    plt.text(merged['% Vaxed'][i] + 1, merged['Mean 2023'][i], merged['ReportingCountry'][i], fontsize=8)
 
plt.xlabel('Percent Vaccinated as of 2023')
plt.ylabel('Mean Excess Mortality 2023')
plt.title(f"\n Vaccination uptake versus mean excess mortality\n$rvalue$ = {round(regression.rvalue,4)} \n$pvalue$ = {round(regression.pvalue,4)}")
plt.plot(percent_vaxed_wk1_23, regression[1] + regression[0]*percent_vaxed_wk1_23, 'r', label='fitted line')

plt.show()
```

This initial linear regression plot yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.63, indicating a moderate postitive correlation between mean 2023 excess all-cause mortality and the percentage of the population that was vaccinated at the end of 2022. The positive correlation suggests that the higher a country's proportion of vaccinated individuals, the higher their levels of excess all-cause mortality. The gradient of the best fit line suggests that for every 1% incresase in vaccination uptake a 0.344% increase in excess mortaility is to be expected. A very small p-value of 0.0003 enables us to have high confidence that the observed correlation did not arise from our null-model of no correlation.
 
Our analysis is not sufficiently robust to provide evidence of a causal relationship between vaccination uptake in 2022 and excess mortaility in 2023. We have not allowed for confounding variables. In addition, regression assumes a linear realtionship between the two variables, which may not be the case. 

##### Residual error plot



In order to check whether linear regression is an appropriate technique to investigate the relationship between a country's percentage of vaccinated individals and its excess mortality, we then decided to explore the residual errors from the above linear regression.


The following plot demonstrates the residual error in terms of vertical distance between each data point and each fitted value.

```{python}
#A plot to demonstrate the acutal values, predicted values and residual error
import residual_plot
residual_plot.plot_with_errors(merged['% Vaxed'], merged['Mean 2023'], regression.intercept, regression.slope)
plt.xlabel('Percent Vaccinated as of 2023')
plt.ylabel('Mean Excess Mortality 2023')
plt.title('Depicting residual error')
```

We used a residual vs fitted value plot to check whether the relationship between a country' percentage of vaccinated individals and its excess mortality, is adequately captured by a linear model.

```{python}
# Checking for linearity
predicted = regression.intercept + regression.slope * merged['% Vaxed']
residual = merged['Mean 2023'] - predicted
plt.scatter(x=predicted, y=residual, color='blue')
plt.title('Residuals vs. Fitted Values Plot')
plt.xlabel('Fitted Values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals')
# Add a horizontal line at y=0 for reference
plt.axhline(y=0, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=1) 
plt.show()
```

 Ideally, the residuals should be randomly scattered around zero, and there should be no discernible pattern. As there doesn't appear to be a discernable pattern in how the residuals are distributed from left to right, and they look randomly scattered around zero, we can be relatively confident of a linear relationship between the percentage of vaccinated individuals in a country and mean 2023 excess mortality.


We then checked whether the assumption made by linear regression that the residual errors follow a normal distribution was correct, using a histogram plot. 

```{python}
#Plotting a histogram of the residual errors
predicted = regression.intercept + regression.slope * merged['% Vaxed']
plt.hist(merged['Mean 2023'] - predicted)
plt.xlabel('Residual error')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Plotting the distribution of the residual errors')
```

This histogram doesn't help us very much, as it doesn't look bell-shaped but also doesn't give us a very good idea of what the distribution is.


- EXPAND ON THIS FURTHER - maybe speak to matthew

##### Assumptions/limitations

- Using vaccination percentage up to 2023 then mean mortality since start of 2023
- Mean mortality across 2023 could flatten the seasonality of excess mortality?
- Just focusing on first doses
- We know it is correlated but the question is whether vaccination rate impacted excess mortality - look into confounding variables 

##### Regression of mean excess mortality against vaccination percentage for EU countries by vaccination 


So far, we have only investigated whether there seems to be a relationship between the percentage of vaccinated individuals and 2023 excess mortality across EU countries. We have only explored this in terms of vaccination *by any* Covid-19 vaccine. 

However, our vaccination data includes the monthly number of first doses by each vaccination type (for each country). Furthermore, WRITE HERE THAT IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES WHICH EACH VACCINE TYPE USES - and therefore it is likely that each vaccine type could have a different impact on the health of individuals, and therefore excess mortality.

Therefore, we decided to plot a linear regression of percentage vaccinated against excess mortality for each Covid-19 vaccination type. 

```{python}
by_type_and_country = vaccine_data[(vaccine_data['Year'] != '2023') & (vaccine_data['TargetGroup'] == 'ALL')].groupby(['ReportingCountry','Vaccine'])['FirstDose'].sum()
by_type_and_country = by_type_and_country.reset_index()
```


```{python}
population_wk1_23 = vaccine_data[vaccine_data['YearWeekISO'] == '2023-W01'].groupby('ReportingCountry')['Population'].first()
```

```{python}
by_type_and_country = pd.merge(by_type_and_country, population_wk1_23, on = 'ReportingCountry')
```

```{python}
by_type_and_country['% vaxed'] = by_type_and_country['FirstDose'] / by_type_and_country['Population']
```

```{python}
just_means = excess_mortality[['Mean 2023', 'ReportingCountry']]
```

```{python}
vaccine_rename = {
    'AZ' : 'Astrazeneca',
    'COM' : 'Pfizer',
    'COMBA.1' : 'PfizerBA1',
    'COMBA.4-5' : 'PfizerBA4_5',
    'JANSS' : 'Janssen',
    'MOD' : 'Moderna',
    'MODBA.1' : 'ModernaBA1',
    'MODBBA.4-5' : 'ModernaBA4_5',
    'NVXD' : 'Novavax',
    'UNK' : 'Unknown',
    'VLA' : 'Valneva',
    'SPU' : 'Sputnik',
    'COMBIV' : 'PfizerBA1_4_5',
    'MODBIV' : 'ModernaBA1_4_5',
    'BECNBG' : 'BeijingCNBG',
    'SGSK' : 'SanofiGSK',
    'BHACOV' : 'BharatCovaxin',
    'SIN' : 'SinoVac'
}
by_type_and_country['VaccineType'] = by_type_and_country['Vaccine'].replace(vaccine_rename)
by_type_and_country[['VaccineType']]
```

```{python}
vaccine_type = by_type_and_country['VaccineType'].drop_duplicates()
vaccine_type
```

```{python}
import merge
import plot1
```

```{python}
vaccine_dict = merge.merge_vaccines(by_type_and_country, just_means, vaccine_type)
#vaccine_dict
```

```{python}
plot1.plot_vax(vaccine_dict, '% vaxed', 'Mean 2023')
```

```{python}
import regression_type
```

```{python}
table_regress_type = regression_type.linregress_table(vaccine_dict)
table_regress_type.apply(lambda s: s.apply('{0:.5f}'.format))
```

### Permutation test


The p-value and r-values from the linregress function assume linearity and independence of the given variables. Unfortunately, due to the highly interconnected value of mortality which can be affected by a variety of factors and the fact that the vaccination rate itself is affected by death rates it is un-wise to take those values at face value.

Instead we chose to use the permutation test. A method that shuffles one column of variables between two different types of vaccines and then takes the slope for each new null word vaccine substracts them and compare the given difference to the real world slope difference. It does this thousands of times and tells you have far the real world data is from a null world hypothesis. Ie: in worlds where the relationship between vaccine rates and mortality rates is random how many times would you find the real world value.

In our case between Astrazeneca and Pfizer their data is so unlikely that among a million trials their difference never shows up. This means that the model we’be made is extremely significant.

```{python}
PFI = sps.linregress(vaccine_dict['Pfizer']['% vaxed'], vaccine_dict['Pfizer']['Mean 2023'])
ASTRA = sps.linregress(vaccine_dict['Astrazeneca']['% vaxed'], vaccine_dict['Astrazeneca']['Mean 2023'])
SDIFF = ASTRA.slope - PFI.slope
```

```{python}
import permutation
rng = np.random.default_rng()
#permutation.permute('Pfizer', 'Astrazeneca')
#The function when imported from the .py file cannot read and use files from this main notbook which means it cannot access the dictionnary with the vaccines.
#Go to permutation.py file to see the step-by-step build up of the permutation test based on last year's textbook.
```

```{python}
def permute(Vax1_str, Vax2_str):
    Vax1 = sps.linregress(vaccine_dict[Vax1_str]['% vaxed'], vaccine_dict[Vax1_str]['Mean 2023'])
    Vax2 = sps.linregress(vaccine_dict[Vax2_str]['% vaxed'], vaccine_dict[Vax2_str]['Mean 2023'])
    real_diff = Vax1.slope - Vax2.slope
    first_array = vaccine_dict[Vax1_str]['% vaxed']
    second_array = vaccine_dict[Vax2_str]['% vaxed']
    pool = np.concatenate([first_array, second_array])

    
    fake_difference = np.zeros(10000)

When running the above code the closer you get to 5000 the less significant the model is. The closer it is to 0 or 10000 the better the level of significance. Among our data the relationship between mortality rates and vaccine rates can be confirmed.
